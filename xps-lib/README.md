# Library
## What am I
XPS is a library to convert XML to HTML or PDF documents via XSLT 2.0 processing. It uses Templates on the server or on a network drive 
to convert XML content delivered as a String value and takes into account the locale given.

XPS uses the following 3rd party libraries. For license information and other stuff see their website.
- Apache Fop Library (https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/)
- Saxon HE XSLT Processor (https://www.saxonica.com/products/products.xml)

## Usage
To convert files use the following classes:
 
- XML to HTML: <code>Xml2HtmlConverter</code>
- XML to PDF: <code>Xml2PdfConverter</code>

To convert the file, use the following method. It returns the document as a byte array.

```
public interface IXsltConverter {   
    /**   
     * creates a document of any type (ByteArray can be a PDF, HTML or whatever) based on XML, an XSLT stylesheet and a locale   
     *
     * @param xml              XML content
     * @param templateFileName file name of the XSLT stylesheet
     * @param locale           locale for presentation and translation of the document
     * @return ByteArray with the document created
     */
    byte[] convertXml(final String xml, final String templateFileName, final String locale);
    }
```

 # Added Functionality
 ## XSLT Expansions
 The XSLT functionality was slightly enhanced by the following options:
 
 - the collection finder can handle UNC network paths
 - the library can localize dates not only by XSLT but also by java
    - for an example call ```doc(concat('date/long`, current-date())``` to get a Java long style formatted current date
    - formats available:
        - ```/date/short/``` leads to Java ```DateFormat.SHORT```
        - ```/date/long/``` leads to Java ```DateFormat.LONG```
        - ```/date/medium/``` leads to Java ```DateFormat.MEDIUM```
        - ```/date/month/``` leads to Java Simple Date with Format "MMMM"
        - ```/date/medium_month/``` leads to Java Simple Date with Format "MMM"
 - language (i18n) used can be queried
    - call ```doc('language)``` 
    
## Date Format Correction
This library has some date format corrections that were issued by a client. It's in fact the case, that some french 
and italian terms in certain cases are not correct in certain Java versions.
