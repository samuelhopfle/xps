# XPS #
## What am I? ##
XPS is a library with a set of restfull http microservices to convert XML to HTML or PDF documents via XSLT 2.0 processing. It uses Templates on the server or on a network drive 
to convert XML content delivered as a String value and takes into account the locale given. It can be used as followed:

- directly in the code (see ```./xps-lib/README.md```)
- as a set of restful microservices

XPS uses the following 3rd party libraries. For license information and other stuff see their website.
- Apache Fop Library (https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/)
- Saxon HE XSLT Processor (https://www.saxonica.com/products/products.xml)

*Java Version used is 11 (or higher). This container runs on Apache Tomcat Servlet Container 9.0 (or higher).*

## Examples
Example templates can be found in the path:
```./src/main/webapp/templates``` (```.xslt``` for HTML, ```.fo``` for PDF)

The related curl calls can be found in the file:
```./example_calls.txt```

## Run & deploy
* run with gradle ```bootRun```   
* deploy with gradle ```build```

# Functionality
## Basics
- print service for template based converting of
	- XML to PDF
	- XML to HTML
	- XML to XML
- document templates with XSLT 2.0 standard
- webservice with a restful HTTP protocol
    - XML-data via POST
    - file access via UNC network access

## Features supported
- include graphics or other documents
- i18n (internationalization) and translation
    - i18n formatting via XSLT
    - translations via XSLT
    - date can be formatted with java 18n
- SVG is supported

 ## XSLT Expansions
 The XSLT functionality was slightly enhanced by the following options:
 
 - the collection finder can handle UNC network paths
 - the library can localize dates not only by XSLT but also by java
    - for an example call ```doc(concat('date/long`, current-date())``` to get a Java long style formatted current date
    - formats available:
        - ```/date/short/``` leads to Java ```DateFormat.SHORT```
        - ```/date/long/``` leads to Java ```DateFormat.LONG```
        - ```/date/medium/``` leads to Java ```DateFormat.MEDIUM```
        - ```/date/month/``` leads to Java Simple Date with Format "MMMM"
        - ```/date/medium_month/``` leads to Java Simple Date with Format "MMM"
 - language (i18n) used can be queried
    - call ```doc('language)
    
## Date Format Correction
This library has some date format corrections that were issued by a client. It's in fact the case, that some french 
and italian terms in certain cases are not correct in certain Java versions.
